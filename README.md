tarefas

a simple task management application built with python and tkinter. users can add, cross out, postpone and delete tasks.
made for people who enjoy making lists but don't always want to write them down with pen and paper. you still get to cross out completed tasks though.

with tarefas you can:  
* add up to ten tasks per day
* add and edit future tasks as well
* keep a record of past tasks (unless deleted)

it's just four buttons:
➕ add new task  
✖️ delete selected task(s)  
✔️ cross out selected task(s)  
➡️ postpone selected task(s) to the next day

developed by coding beginner 4L4N4F in 2025 as a first endeavor in pyhton.
